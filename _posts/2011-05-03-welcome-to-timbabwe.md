title: Welcome to TIMBABWE
excerpt: This is the first time I’ve had a website since 2003. I’m starting it to not only establish something of a personal brand and a unified center to find me across all the various social networks, but also to allow me to write on subjects that aren’t relevant for my company‘s blog, like my interests in aviation and becoming a pilot, and my adventures with my home studio. We’ll see how it goes.

This is the first time I've had a website since 2003. I'm starting it to not only establish something of a personal brand and a unified center to find me across all the various social networks, but also to allow me to write on subjects that aren't relevant for <a href="http://www.thenewgroup.com">my company</a>'s blog, like my interests in aviation and becoming a pilot, and my adventures with my home studio. We'll see how it goes.
